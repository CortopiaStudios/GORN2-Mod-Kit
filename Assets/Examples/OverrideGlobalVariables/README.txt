Make the OverridePlayerSpeedAndScale.prefab addressable with the level "Singleton" to spawn the object as soon as the mod is loaded. It references global variables in the game as asset references to make sure the correct instances are used. If the global variables in this project are used with direct references the mod will build copies of the variables that wont be referenced by the rest of the game.
